## Summary of Agile Values

> (Agile Manifesto Values)

### 1. **Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools**
- **Synopsis**: Prioritize collaboration and communication over rigid processes or tools.
- **In Practice**: Use daily standups and MS Teams for seamless communication. Engage in technical discussions for collaborative problem-solving instead of sticking to predefined processes.
- **In Practice**: Foster a culture of openness, encouraging the team to discuss blockers or new ideas informally.
- **Example**: A developer encounters a performance issue with MongoDB and, instead of following a strict issue-resolution protocol, discusses it during the daily standup to seek quick team input.
- **Example**: During a sprint, team members may adjust the approach to handling API requests based on quick feedback from each other in standups or MS Teams chats.
- **Quote**: "The best way to predict the future is to create it." — *Abraham Lincoln* ([Source](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/abraham_lincoln_121786))
- **Quote**: "People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care." — *John C. Maxwell* ([Source](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/john_c_maxwell_121736))

### 2. **Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation**
- **Synopsis**: Focus on delivering functional software rather than excessive documentation.
- **In Practice**: Leverage TDD (Test Driven Development) as documentation for the API behavior. Write tests to ensure correctness and serve as a living specification.
- **In Practice**: Create user stories and behavior tests to document functionality instead of long-form docs.
- **Example**: Writing a test for search queries like "find by description" not only confirms functionality but also documents expected behavior.
- **Example**: During development, the team can validate user stories by ensuring the code meets defined acceptance criteria, effectively documenting the functionality.
- **Quote**: "Documentation is a love letter that you write to your future self." — *Dane Hillard* ([Source](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6887-documentation-is-a-love-letter-that-you-write-to-your))
- **Quote**: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." — *Leonardo da Vinci* ([Source](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/leonardo_da_vinci_121327))

### 3. **Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation**
- **Synopsis**: Focus on meeting the customer's needs, even without direct access to them, by researching similar systems and leveraging available data.
- **In Practice**: Collaborate internally to define user stories based on research and experience, ensuring the API aligns with the users’ real needs.
- **In Practice**: Use generative AI tools to synthesize feedback from other sources, such as reviews of similar systems, to inform API design decisions.
- **Example**: While lacking direct access to users, the team could research how other auction systems handle search functionality and apply similar approaches.
- **Example**: The team iterates on the search algorithm based on feedback from internal stakeholders, continuously refining the approach for simplicity and relevance.
- **Quote**: "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." — *African Proverb* ([Source](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/african_proverb_121051))
- **Quote**: "Agile is not about delivering what was agreed. It’s about delivering what the customer needs." — *James Shore* ([Source](https://www.agilealliance.org/))

### 4. **Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**
- **Synopsis**: Embrace changes as they arise to improve product and process, rather than rigidly sticking to a plan.
- **In Practice**: Adjust the API’s search functionality based on emerging insights or changing requirements, even if these weren’t anticipated at the beginning of the sprint.
- **In Practice**: Foster a culture where the team can pivot based on technical challenges or opportunities for optimization during the sprint.
- **Example**: After feedback from the product owner (or internal stakeholders), the team shifts focus from implementing basic search functionality to refining the algorithm with semantic search.
- **Example**: The team might revise the approach to filtering results by implementing better ranking techniques when the current approach isn’t delivering optimal results.
- **Quote**: "Plans are nothing; planning is everything." — *Dwight D. Eisenhower* ([Source](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/dwight_d_eisenhower_129276))
- **Quote**: "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." — *Nelson Mandela* ([Source](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/nelson_mandela_121144))

> Some vaules that are also sometimes included

## 5. **Simplicity—The Art of Maximizing the Amount of Work Not Done**
- **Synopsis**: Prioritize simplicity by avoiding unnecessary complexity and focusing on what really matters.
- **In Practice**: Focus on developing a lean API that meets the core needs of the users—searching relevant auction items—without adding unnecessary features.
- **In Practice**: Use MVP (Minimum Viable Product) principles to release a functional search API and refine it iteratively based on feedback.
- **Example**: Rather than building complex sorting mechanisms, the team opts to focus first on keyword-based search, delivering core functionality with the simplest approach.
- **Example**: By using generative AI for code documentation, the team reduces the time spent writing manual comments, maximizing time spent on code that adds value.
- **Quote**: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." — *Leonardo da Vinci* ([Source](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/leonardo_da_vinci_121327))
- **Quote**: "The simplest things are often the truest." — *Richard Bach* ([Source](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/richard_bach_146353))
- Agile Manifesto (Principle 10: "Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential").

## 6. **Sustainable Development**
- **Synopsis**: Promote a pace of work that is sustainable over the long term to avoid burnout and maintain efficiency.
- **In Practice**: Foster work-life balance by setting realistic sprint goals and avoiding overwork, particularly for remote teams with different geographical locations.
- **In Practice**: Use regular retrospectives to evaluate team velocity and adjust work practices to ensure sustainability.
- **Example**: After a sprint, the team assesses their workload and adjusts goals for the next sprint, ensuring no one is overloaded, even in a remote setting.
- **Example**: The team uses MS Teams to discuss any blockers related to time zones or work-life balance and plans work hours accordingly.
- **Quote**: "It’s not the load that breaks you down, it’s the way you carry it." — *Lou Holtz* ([Source](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/lou_holtz_121205))
- **Quote**: "Sustainability is no longer about doing less harm. It’s about doing more good." — *Jochen Zeitz* ([Source](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/sustainability))
- (Principle 8: "Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely").

## 7. **Continuous Delivery of Valuable Software**
- **Synopsis**: Regularly deliver functional software that adds value to the customer or user.
- **In Practice**: Deliver working iterations of the search API early and often, allowing for quick feedback and adjustments.
- **In Practice**: Use continuous integration and deployment to ensure the API remains functional after each sprint and that new features are continuously tested and deployed.
- **Example**: After a sprint, the team deploys a working version of the search API with basic keyword search and validates its behavior through unit tests.
- **Example**: As part of each sprint, the team releases a new version of the API that refines the search ranking algorithm based on recent feedback.
- **Quote**: "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." — *Alan Kay* ([Source](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/alan_kay_121354))
- **Quote**: "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." — *Steve Jobs* ([Source](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/steve_jobs_416859))
- Continuous Delivery is a principle in several Agile methodologies, particularly those influenced by Lean or DevOps practices.

## Summary Agile Practices

### 1. **Sprint Planning**
- **Synopsis**: Sprint Planning is a Scrum event where the team determines the work to be completed during the upcoming sprint, ensuring alignment with the sprint goal and product backlog priorities.
- **In Practice**: 
  - Teams collaborate with the product owner to prioritize tasks and define a clear sprint goal.
  - Developers commit to work that is feasible based on their capacity and velocity.
- **Example**: A Scrum team agrees to implement three user stories, focusing on improving login functionality and resolving related bugs.
- **Quote**: "The purpose of Sprint Planning is to define what can be delivered in the Sprint and how that work will be achieved." - Scrum Alliance :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
- **Link**: [Scrum Alliance on Sprint Planning](https://www.scrumalliance.org)

### 2. **Daily Stand-Ups**
- **Synopsis**: A short daily meeting where team members discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
- **In Practice**:
  - Teams use a structured format (e.g., what was done yesterday, today’s tasks, and blockers).
  - Ensures transparency and quick identification of issues.
- **Example**: During a stand-up, a developer highlights an API integration issue, prompting the team to adjust priorities to resolve it.
- **Quote**: "Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify impediments to development..." - Scrum Guide :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- **Link**: [Scrum Guide on Daily Scrums](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide)

### 3. **Retrospectives**
- **Synopsis**: A regular meeting where the team reflects on the previous sprint to identify successes and areas for improvement.
- **In Practice**:
  - Teams employ formats like "Start, Stop, Continue" or focus on specific challenges encountered during the sprint.
  - Action items are documented and tracked to ensure continuous improvement.
- **Example**: A retrospective highlights inefficiencies in the code review process, leading to a revised workflow for future sprints.
- **Quote**: "The retrospective is a place to deal with problems, concerns, and issues and provides a safe place to address these." - nTask :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- **Link**: [nTask on Agile Retrospectives](https://www.ntaskmanager.com/blog/agile-best-practices/)

### 4. **Backlog Refinement**
- **Synopsis**: A process for keeping the product backlog updated and ensuring that upcoming items are ready for sprint planning.
- **In Practice**:
  - Teams break down large stories into smaller, manageable tasks and clarify requirements.
  - Discussions include priority adjustments based on business needs.
- **Example**: A product owner and team refine a feature by breaking it into three smaller stories with clear acceptance criteria.
- **Quote**: "Backlog refinement is about creating clarity on what is required and why, before development starts." - Atlassian :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
- **Link**: [Atlassian on Backlog Refinement](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs)

### 5. **Scrum/Kanban Boards**
- **Synopsis**: A visual management tool to track work in progress and limit bottlenecks.
- **In Practice**:
  - Teams use boards to categorize tasks (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
  - Work-in-progress (WIP) limits prevent overloading team members.
- **Example**: A Kanban board shows five tasks in progress, prompting the team to complete existing tasks before starting new ones.
- **Quote**: "Kanban practices such as limiting work in progress help reduce waste and focus team efforts." - Kanban University :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
- **Link**: [Kanban University on Kanban Practices](https://www.kanban.university)

### 6. **Agile Testing**
- **Synopsis**: A continuous testing approach that integrates quality assurance throughout the development process.
- **In Practice**:
  - Teams employ test-driven development (TDD) or automated testing frameworks.
  - Frequent testing ensures issues are identified early, reducing the cost of fixing bugs.
- **Example**: A team writes unit tests for a new feature before implementation, ensuring robust coverage.
- **Quote**: "Testing is not a phase. Testing happens concurrently with development." - Atlassian :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
- **Link**: [Atlassian on Agile Testing](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/testing)

### 7. **Pair Programming**
- **Synopsis**: Two developers work together at one workstation, collaboratively writing code and reviewing it in real-time.
- **In Practice**:
  - Teams rotate pairs to promote knowledge sharing and improve code quality.
  - Pairing helps new team members onboard faster by pairing with experienced developers.
- **Example**: A senior developer pairs with a junior colleague to debug a complex algorithm, sharing insights and techniques.
- **Quote**: "Pair programming leads to higher-quality code and better collaboration." - Agile Alliance :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

  - [CM] [Value - Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools] We can favour individuals and interactions through having regular and adhoc face-to-face meeting (including daily standups), and through having lively discussions in our MS Teams group. We should aim to be transparent and honest about what we are doing, and the challenges we are facing, by using tools/practices like daily standups and MS Teams to regularly engage with each other.
  - [CM] [Value - Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation] Our Unit Tests, act as both a specification, and documentation.

As specification & documentation - Using TDD or Jest ToDos document features by groups, and act as a specification for those features. We could also add BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) where we create and test against user stories. This would ensure we are delivering software that provide maximum benifit to the end-user.

[TDD Test Run of Jest ToDo's for the CLI tool for seeding MongDB with our test auction data]

```bash
npm test

> src@1.0.0 test
> jest

  - [CM] [Practice - Sprint Planning] We have created a backlog in JIRA for our first sprint, with Epics for each developer, and and epic for team task. We will review the backlog after our Daily Standup at 8:30pm tonight, and decide what goes into this weeks sprint. This will ensure that we are aligned on our sprint goals and backlog priorities for this sprint.

  - [CR] [Value - Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools] Meeting with other developers to share ideas and challenges, and to work together to resolve them. I ran into a lot of errors and asking Cameron and Swaroop how to handle them was much more helpful than trying to debug it all by myself. There are many recommendations that were given to make problems go away.

  - [CR] [Value - Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation] While bad documentation is a problem, it's not as bad as bad code. We can use tools like TDD to make our software self-documenting, and to make it easy to understand. We can also use tools to generate documentation for us. I focused on making our software self-documenting, and using tools to generate documentation for us. So we can focus on working software, and not on comprehensive documentation. TDD allows me to make sure that my code is working correctly, and to make sure that my code is easy to understand.
